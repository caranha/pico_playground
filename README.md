# Pico Playground

I love programming in
[pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). Here you can find the
carts that I have made over the years. 

Some of them are complete, some of them are tiny. Some are just tests.

Maybe something here will interest you? Feel free to browse and take
what you find interesting!

## Full Games

These are games that I consider more or less complete. Maybe they will
updated if the lucky moon rises? You can find some of them on [my itch
page](https://caranha.itch.io/), so you can play them even without
pico8.

- [Pico Factory](./picofactory) -- my first pico8 game, made for Ludum
  Dare 37. You can build a factory of tasty foods.
- [Shy Gladiator](./deicultro) -- made for Ludum Dare 39, with [Felipe
  Kolb Bernardes](https://feijuadacomics.tumblr.com/). You are a hero
  that defeat monsters without attacking them.
- [LifeVac](./lifevac) -- made for Ludum Dare 44, with [Cornet
  Theory](https://onlyintheory.com/). It is a weird game, but the
  sound track is awesome!
- [Harvest Tataki](./harvesttataki) -- made for Ludum Dare 52. The
  game is pretty simple, but people seemed to enjoy it! You can also
  play it [on itch](https://caranha.itch.io/harvesttataki).
- [Snake](./snake) -- This tiny game has not been uploaded anywhere,
  but it will not rest if it is not placed together with its bigger
  brothers.

## Tiny Carts

These are tiny carts. I probably spent less than a day in each of
them, but they are made with love.

Enter [these rooms](./tinycarts) and feel free to explore! I may leave
some notes to help you in each room.

# License 

The carts that I made alone are all CC-BY. Feel free to take what you
want from them, and I hope they are useful for you!

The carts that I made with other people, well, you should ask them too
if you want to do something with their art. Although I think they
would probably fine with it, it does not hurt to ask!
