These are tiny carts among the tiny carts. Abandoned ideas or quick
studies, most of these are woefully incomplete. Although maybe there
is a diamond in the rough? Who knows? Feel free to check them out! If
you like something, by all means use it for your project!

- `bezier.p8`: Animation with bezier curves.
- `bignum.p8`: One of my games needed bignum, and I was practing it here.
- `boids.p8`: boids draft for the "fish" cart.
- `cair.p8`: The logo of a department at uni looked like a tetris
  piece, so I made this.
- `car.p8`: A friend wanted to make a car game with me. They made the
  sprites, I made the code. But it didn't go very far. There is
  collision and the car for some reason shoots bullets.
- `chase.p8`: I was tring to make a demo for a shmup, where the ship
  automatically dodged meteors.
- `chopper.p8`: I really liked the choplifter game when I was a kid.
- `connect4.p8`: Not working anymore, but this used to play connect4
  badly with MCTS.
- `dog.p8`: Woof.
- `evoart.p8`: Many years ago I was watching a talk on art by
  evolutionary computation, and it inspired me to write this cart.
- `friendtent.p8`: Prototype for Friendship Jam. This is a cool idea
  that I should go back to. Art by chamotea.
- `gorillas.p8`: gorillas.bas was a big influence in my childhood.
- `inertia.p8`: I'm not sure what kind of game I wanted to do with
  this. Something with procedural generation.
- `mapgame.p8`: It's cool how you can make something like this really
  quickly on pico8.
- `matching.p8`: I think this is something to do with bipartite graphs.
- `maxsat.p8`: I wanted to do a quick 3sat solver for a class.
- `memory.p8`: I had a phase of trying to do mini games
- `music2.p8`: A cool song
- `music_train.p8`: Me trying to make a full song. I used this for the
  picofactory game.
- `pbert.p8`: I loved qbert when I was a kid. There are better qbert
  games for pico8 out there.
- `plants.p8`: The first time I went to pico pico cafe I made this!
  First time I talked to zep too!
- `rain.p8`: Rain particles
- `rotation_1.p8`: sprite rotation function.
- `runner.p8`: Trying to make an infinite runner with procedural
  generation of the map.
- `schump.p8`: This one did not go very far.
- `triangle.p8`: Practicing 3D rendering.
- `tsukubalogo.p8`: Importing the logo into the spritesheet.
- `tunnel.p8`: More fun with bezier curves. (makes you a bit dizzy)
- `windowtest.p8`: Opening and closing dialogue windows.
