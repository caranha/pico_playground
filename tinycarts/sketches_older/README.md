# Sketches (Older)

Very short carts, usually made in a day or less. Simple games, or
animation, or music that I kinda thought stood on their own. There is
a wide range of dates here, from 2017 to 2022.

- `birthday.p8`: Particle effects, waving text, and a message for a
  nice person.
- `bonsai.p8`: Cellular automata and sand game. Reset many times for a
  nice effect.
- `bouncefade.p8`: This was a time when I was trying to get into the
  habit of writing many short carts. Using a pset loop instead of cls
  to erase stuff is cool.
- `circles.p8`: Pset coloring based on distance from a set of points.
- `distance.p8`: This one looks more complicated than it is. A set of
  points, and lines appears between each pair of them based on
  distance.]
- `fish.p8`: One of my favorites. There is a lot going on in this
  cart. It was at a time I was trying to make "aquarium" carts that
  you could leave in your desktop while you worked.
- `flying.p8`: Simple rules to make a complex animation.
- `lautomata.p8`: 1 dimensional Wolfram life automata.
- `leaves.p8`: trying to learn how to do 3d stuff.
- `mountainview.p8`: Another "aquarium" cart. This one is quite
  involved, and uses the computer time and date to decide how the
  mountains will look like (day, night, seasons, etc).
- `music.p8`: For a while, I tried to learn how to make music. I still
  can't, but I put my best efforts in the cart, with a little menu and
  animation.
- `particle.p8`: Don't mind me, I'm just experimenting with particle
  emmiters.
- `poem.p8`: One time, I was calling these short carts "poems". That's
  a nice name for a short program made for other people to enjoy.
