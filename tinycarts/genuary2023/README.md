# Genuary 2023

These cartridges were made in January 2023 for the "genuary"
theme. Unfortunately, January is a pretty busy month for me, so I
could not work on many prompts.

- `genuary1.p8`: "Perfect loop", a quick warm up using several techniques.
- `genuary6.p8`: "Steal like an artist". I saw this nead animation by
  someone else on mastodon, and tried to remake it in pico-8. Didn't
  work very well.
- `genuary6b.p8`: An improved version of the previous one, but not
  quite perfect yet (I did make a perfect version, but can't find it...)
- `genuary22.p8`: A tiny village generator. I really liked this one,
  and want to work more on it.
- `genuary23.p8`: Moire patterns. Looks better as gif than on pico8
- `genuary24.p8`: "muri simulator", incomplete, supposed to be a
  generator of unreasonable suggestions.
