# Tiny Code Christmas 2022

This was a tutorial series on sizecoding (write small code) and
demoscene effects. It was quite fun to put together, and I learned a
lot! [You can find the original videos and prompts
here](https://tcc.lovebyte.party/).

- `day1.p8` -- a simple scene with colorful snowmen
- `day2.p8` -- now with animated snow!
- `day3.p8` -- moving pixel pattern (slow)
- `day3a.p8` -- made it faster using `cam()`
- `day4.p8` -- lava effect! I always liked these.
- `day5.p8` -- polar coordinates based effect. Also, look ma, no `cls()`!
- `day6.p8` -- I don't remember the theme for this, but I added a
  mysterious statement, demoscene style.
- `day7.p8` -- Putting things from previous days together.
- `day8.p8` -- Worm effect. Another effect that I always liked, it was
  nice learning how to do it.
- `day9.p8` -- Shadebob, but make it fire.
- `day10.p8` -- Alternating effects. Welcome to snow!
- `day11.p8` -- 3D spinning cube!
- `day11a.p8` -- Better 3D! less balls, more sorting, and star background!
